# Hello!
I'm Sun-Q Kim, a designer expanding across emerging technology fields.
Branching from my background in Architecture, I plan on exploring other mediums of design that impact our future lives.

# TDF Weekly Progress
## Week 1 : 240905 First Fabrication

We were tasked to fabricate any object whether by 3D printing or laser cutting.
Being an Architecture major student, I'm familiar with either method, though I've never actually done the actual hands-on work myself.
I thought I'd choose laser cutting for now since I expected that I'll be using it more than the 3d Printer for upcoming projects.

Upon wondering what to make as well as trying not to over-engineer something as my first project, I realized I haven't got myself a Berkeley MDes souvenir yet!
I decided to create a Key-chain / Desk Toy that reminds me that I've finally enrolled in Berkeley MDes.

This was the first time I've prepared the material, set it in the laser cutter, sent the work to the laser cutting software, make sure the settings were correct etc.
It did take some Trial & Error and did take time to get my way around the Laser Cutter but I thought this opportunity was a good chance to get familiar with the machine for future purposes.
I'll be trying out the 3D Printer next!
