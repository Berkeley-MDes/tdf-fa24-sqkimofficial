## Week 2 Part 1 : 240908 Breaking down the Grasshopper Algorithm

Well, this class we were ambushed by a Grasshopper Algorithm used to create a Cellphone Stand.

The algorithm could be broken down into 4 main parts.
I borrowed professor Dubberly's method of concept mapping here. (Thank you!)
1) Preparing the Foundations of the Cellphone Stand
2) Designing the Aesthetics of the Cellphone Stand (Through subtracting shapes)
3) Importing & Adjusting the Cellphone Model
4) Evaluating the Product's Feasibility

I played around with the parameters of the sphere to change the aesthetics of the Cellphone Stand.
It didn't seem to change the feasibility of the product.

However, playing with the parameters of the subtracted cylinder seemed to cause problems with the feasibility evaluations.
It was interesting to see how it evaluator component produced texts that described the reason of the faulty feasibility as well as changing the simulated color.

I made a set of my own components to replace the original Sphere form to come up with different aesthetics for the Cellphone stand.
I made sure to adjust the number slider parameters to make the product pass the feasibility evaluation test.

## Week 1 : 240905 First Fabrication

We were tasked to fabricate any object whether by 3D printing or laser cutting.
Being an Architecture major student, I'm familiar with either method, though I've never actually done the actual hands-on work myself.
I thought I'd choose laser cutting for now since I expected that I'll be using it more than the 3d Printer for upcoming projects.

Upon wondering what to make as well as trying not to over-engineer something as my first project, I realized I haven't got myself a Berkeley MDes souvenir yet!
I decided to create a Key-chain / Desk Toy that reminds me that I've finally enrolled in Berkeley MDes.

![Outcome](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/075b4721-c860-4dd7-bb53-baf5218539b5)

The thickness of the plywood was 0.25 inches but when I set the lasercutter settings to 0.25, the laser didn't manage to completely cut through the wood at certain spots of the wood. After adjusting the thickness to 0.275 inches it managed to cut the whole thing seamlessly.

This was the first time I've prepared the material, set it in the laser cutter, sent the work to the laser cutting software, make sure the settings were correct etc. It did take some Trial & Error and did take time to get my way around the Laser Cutter but I thought this opportunity was a good chance to get familiar with the machine for future purposes.
I'll be trying out the 3D Printer next!
